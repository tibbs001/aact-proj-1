        description:         'This project used ClinicalTrials.gov data to summarize characteristics of 40,970 interventional trials registered between October 2007 and September 2010.  Characteristics were compared between trials in three clinical specialties: mental health, cardiovascular and oncology.',
        study_selection_criteria: "Our analysis was restricted to interventional studies registered with ClinicalTrials.gov between October 2007 and September 2010. To identify interventional studies, we used studies.study_type which provides the following choices: interventional, observational, expanded access, and not available (NA). Interventional studies were regrouped within the downloaded, derivative database according to the 3 clinical specialtiesâ€”cardiovascular, oncology, and mental health. For this regrouping, we used submitted disease condition terms and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms generated by a National Library of Medicine (NLM) algorithm to develop a methodology to annotate, validate, adjudicate, and implement disease condition terms (MeSH and non-MeSH) to create specialty data sets.

A subset of the 2010 MeSH thesaurus from the NLM and a list of non-MeSH (free text) disease condition terms provided by data submitters that appeared in 5 or more interventional studies in the analysis data set were reviewed and annotated by clinical specialists at Duke University Medical Center. Terms were annotated according to their relevance to a given specialty (Y = relevant, N = not relevant). Cardiovascular(N=3437), oncology (N=8992), and mental health (N=3695)studies were identified by searching for relevant MeSH and free text terms in the submitted conditions field, as well the condition MeSH terms generated for each study by the NLM. Because MeSH terms can exist with multiple MeSH IDs in the MeSH thesaurus and relevance to a clinical specialty may depend on the context, only MeSH terms that were consistently coded as relevant (Y) across all MeSH IDs met the criteria for inclusion in this analysis. A single study may have multiple MeSH and/or condition terms, and studies were included if they had one or more terms relevant to the clinical specialty of interest. A study could be included in more than one specialty. The results of these specialty classifications based on searches for relevant terms were validated by comparison with classifications based on manual review. (Tasneem A, Aberle L, Ananth H, et al.

          question:   'How were terms reviewed & assigned to the three clinical specialties (mental health, oncology & cardiovascular)?',
          answer:     'Data submitters (study sponsors or their designees) are requested to provide Condition and Keywords data as MeSH terms when registering a study. Additionally, an NLM algorithm also evaluates studies and applies MeSH terms according to the following steps: 1) study records are checked for the presence of a MeSH term, including synonyms and lexical variations; 2) weighted scores are computed for all matches, with exact matches, lexical variations, and synonyms receiving descending proportional weight; 3) very common terms are excluded to avoid confounding; 4) location by data element is considered and weighted in the term scoring process; and 5) terms with scores exceeding the cutoff value are applied to the respective studies.  (Note that the output from steps 1 and 2 is used for both condition and intervention annotations; the field weights are different for each and divert terms into the target annotation type.) This method does not consider the natural-language context for matched terms or ontologically related concepts that would add specificity.',
